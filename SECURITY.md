# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Always use the most recent version available as `stable` or `latest` in ioBroker.   
There will be no support for outdated versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you identify a vulnerability, please consider that this may affect other people/projects as well. This in mind please
email me (Yannic Labonte <yannic.labonte@gmail.com>) first, so I can react and maybe fix the issue, before it is
published to the public (e.g. in a github issue) and maybe misused by third parties.
